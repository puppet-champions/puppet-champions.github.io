Raphaël is an Infrastructure Developer at [Camptocamp](https://camptocamp.com)
in Lausanne, Switzerland, where he enjoys automating systems wherever there is a need.

He began his open-source journey as Ubuntu core developer in 2006, which led
him into Systems Administration.

Back when he was maintaining a Cfengine platform in 2007, he met Puppet which
became his favorite Configuration Management tool. Then in 2008, he discovered
the [Augeas project](https://augeas.net) and started getting involved in it.

Since 2012, Raphaël has joined Camptocamp and started co-maintaining
many of Camptocamp's open-source projects, in particular
the [public Puppet modules](https://forge.puppet.com/camptocamp).
Part of his job since then has been teaching and consulting,
in particular on Puppet, Docker, Terraform & Kubernetes.

Raphaël is a member of the [Vox Pupuli](https://voxpupuli.org/) and [Hercules Team](https://github.com/hercules-team) communities.

Nowadays, he maintains various automation-related projects, such as
[Augeas](https://augeas.net), [Augeasproviders](https://augeasproviders.com),
[Puppetfile-updater](https://github.com/camptocamp/puppetfile-updater),
[FacterDB](https://camptocamp.github.io/facterdb/),
[Puppet Catalog Diff](https://github.com/camptocamp/puppet-catalog-diff) and its [viewer](https://github.com/camptocamp/puppet-catalog-diff-viewer),
[Puppet Ghostbuster](https://github.com/camptocamp/puppet-ghostbuster),
[Prometheus PuppetDB SD](https://github.com/camptocamp/prometheus-puppetdb-sd),
[Camptocamp's Puppet Kubernetes charts](https://github.com/camptocamp/charts),
some [Puppet](https://github.com/camptocamp/terraform-provider-puppetdb) [related](https://github.com/camptocamp/terraform-provider-puppetca) Terraform providers,
[Terraboard](https://camptocamp.github.io/terraboard/), [Bivac](https://camptocamp.github.io/bivac/)…

When he is not too busy with his children, genealogy-related projects
or worship rehearsal,
Raphaël likes to [tweet](https://twitter.com/raphink),
blog on [dev.to](https://dev.to/raphink), and speak at events. He can also be
found on the [Puppet Community Slack](https://slack.puppet.com/).
