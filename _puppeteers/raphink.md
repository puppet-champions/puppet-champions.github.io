Raphaël is a Solutions Architect at [Isovalent](https://isovalent.com).

He began his open-source journey as Ubuntu core developer in 2006, which led
him into Systems Administration.

Back when he was maintaining a Cfengine platform in 2007, he met Puppet which
became his favorite Configuration Management tool. Then in 2008, he discovered
the [Augeas project](https://augeas.net) and started getting involved in it.

In 2012, Raphaël joined Camptocamp and started co-maintaining
many of Camptocamp's open-source projects, in particular
the [public Puppet modules](https://forge.puppet.com/camptocamp).
Part of his job since then has been teaching and consulting,
in particular on Puppet, Docker, Terraform & Kubernetes.

Raphaël is a member of the [Vox Pupuli](https://voxpupuli.org/) and [Hercules Team](https://github.com/hercules-team) communities.

These days, his focus is the [Cilium Project](https://cilium.io).

When he is not too busy with his children, genealogy-related projects
or worship rehearsal,
Raphaël likes to [tweet](https://twitter.com/raphink),
blog on [dev.to](https://dev.to/raphink), and speak at events. He can also be
found on the [Puppet Community Slack](https://slack.puppet.com/).
