We use the Jekyll templating system for this site. The first section, between
the dashed lines, is called [_Front Matter_](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/). It defines certain variables that we use
to construct your profile. Do not change the keys (the part before the `:`) or the layout.

* The `name` key defines the name displayed on the profiles listing and the headline of your own profile page.
* The `image` key should point to a url of the image you'd like to appear for your profile.
  * If you'd like, you can add it to this repository in the [assets/images/profiles](https://github.com/puppet-community/puppet-community.github.io/tree/master/assets/images/profiles) directory.
  * You'd refer to an image there with a URL of `/assets/images/profiles/{yourname}.jpg`.
* The `bio` text can be anything you want. It will be displayed at the top of your profile
  page, and the first sentence or so will be displayed for _Extraordinary Puppeteers_.

Everything below that Front Matter section is free-form and uses [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

After you approve this PR, an admin will merge it and your profile will appear on the site.
