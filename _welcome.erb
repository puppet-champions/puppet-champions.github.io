Hello <%= member['name'] || member['login'] %>, and welcome to _Puppet Champions_!

Your first task is to update this PR to match what you'd like your profile to
look like, and then approve it when you're done. Switch to the _Files changed_ tab, then
click the `...` icon at the upper right of this file to access the editor.
[[See GitHub documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/approving-a-pull-request-with-required-reviews)]

We use the Jekyll templating system for this site. The first section, between
the dashed lines, is called [_Front Matter_](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/). It defines certain variables that we use
to construct your profile. Do not change the keys (the part before the `:`) or the layout.

* The `name` key defines the name displayed on the profiles listing and the headline of your own profile page.
* The `image` key should point to a url of the image you'd like to appear for your profile.
  * If you'd like, you can add it to this repository in the [assets/images/profiles](https://github.com/puppet-community/puppet-community.github.io/tree/master/assets/images/profiles) directory.
  * You'd refer to an image there with a URL of `/assets/images/profiles/{yourname}.jpg`.
* The `bio` text can be anything you want. It will be displayed at the top of your profile
  page, and the first sentence or so will be displayed for _Extraordinary Puppeteers_.

Everything below that Front Matter section is free-form and uses [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

After you approve this PR, an admin will merge it and your profile will appear on the site.
If you'd also like to join our fledgling Dev.to organization and post on the behalf of the
Puppet Champions group, then you can do that by asking a Puppet Community Team member for
the current secret code, then navigating to your [settings page](https://dev.to/settings/organization) and pasting it in to join the org.

You're welcome to come back and update your profile any time you'd like.
