Proud participant of the very first PuppetCamp in SanFrancisco, he has continued to work and experiment with Puppet.

He is the author of the original [example42 Puppet modules](https://github.com/example42/puppet-modules-nextgen) set and the [puppi module](https://github.com/example42/puppi) then evolved in the [Psick control-repo](https://github.com/example42/psick), [Tiny Puppet](https://github.com/example42/puppet-tp) and the [psick module](https://github.com/example42/puppet-psick).

He is always looking for improved and reusable approaches to Puppet experience, adapting the implementation to the evolution of the language.
Doing this, he happens to do very unconventional Puppet things.

He is now Co-founder and CTO at [example42 GmbH](https://www.example42.com), a Berlin based company that offers Puppet training and consulting services world wide.
